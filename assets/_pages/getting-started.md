The WDL community depends on your involvement to thrive. You are encouraged to ask questions, help other users, and make contributions where you can. Interactions occur primarily on [GitHub](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl) and Slack(https://join.slack.com/t/openwdl/shared_invite/zt-ctmj4mhf-cFBNxIiZYs6SY9HgM9UAVw). The WDL community also has an official [blog](/blog) where announcements are made.

The [WDL language specification](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/blob/wdl-1.1/SPEC.md) contains all relevant information for users and developers, including those wanting to implement an execution engine.
